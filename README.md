# gopbo [![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/g0dsCookie/gopbo)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/g0dsCookie/gopbo)

**gopbo** is a free and open source tool to (un)pack/validate PBO files written in Go. The tool doesn't depend on any platform specific functions. Thus it should run on every platform which is supported by Go.

# Installation

First you need to install the [Go Tools](https://golang.org/doc/install#install).

After the Go Tools have been installed you should set the environment variable GOPATH to point wherever you want to. Also you may want to add <GOPATH>/bin to your PATH.

```shell
go get -u github.com/g0dsCookie/gopbo
go install github.com/g0dsCookie/gopbo
```

Now you are ready to use **gopbo**!
